Merger & Entry
Description
How do you protect an ecosystem you can’t fully see? One way is to listen.

This competition involves building models that automatically identify wildlife species from their vocalizations in audio recordings collected across the Pantanal wetlands. This work will support more reliable biodiversity monitoring in one of the world’s most diverse and threatened ecosystems.

Understanding how ecological communities respond to environmental change and restoration efforts is a central challenge in conservation science. The Pantanal — a wetland spanning 150,000+ km² across Brazil and neighboring countries — is home to over 650 bird species plus countless other animals, yet much of it remains unmonitored. Seasonal flooding, wildfires, agricultural expansion, and climate change make regular fieldwork challenging.

Goal of the Competition
Conventional biodiversity monitoring across vast, remote regions is expensive and logistically demanding. To help address these challenges, a growing network of 1,000 acoustic recorders is being deployed across the Pantanal, running continuously to capture wildlife sounds across different habitats and seasons. Continuous audio recording allows researchers to capture multi-species soundscapes over extended periods, providing a community-level perspective on biodiversity dynamics. But the sheer volume of audio is too large to review manually, and labeled species data is limited.

This competition focuses on the development of machine learning models that identify wildlife species from passive acoustic monitoring (PAM). Proposed approaches should work across different habitats, withstand the constraints of messy, field-collected data, and support evidence-based conservation decisions. Successful solutions will help advance biodiversity monitoring in the last wild places on Earth, including research initiatives in the Pantanal wetlands of Brazil.

Listening carefully, and at scale, may be one of the most effective tools available to protect this landscape.

Working Note Award Criteria
Criteria for the BirdCLEF+ Best Working Note Award:

Originality. The value of a paper is a function of the degree to which it presents new or novel technical material. Does the paper present results previously unknown? Does it push forward the frontiers of knowledge? Does it present new methods for solving old problems or new viewpoints on old problems? Or, on the other hand, is it a rehash of information already known?

Quality. A paper's value is a function of the innate character or degree of excellence of the work described. Was the work performed or the study made with a high degree of thoroughness? Was high engineering skill demonstrated? Is an experiment described which has a high degree of elegance? Or, on the other hand, is the work described pretty much of a run-of-the-mill nature?

Contribution. The value of a paper is a function of the degree to which it represents an overall contribution to the advancement of the art. This is different from originality. A paper may be highly original but may be concerned with a very minor, or even insignificant, matter or problem. On the other hand, a paper may make a great contribution by collecting and analyzing known data and facts and pointing out their significance. Or, a fine exposition of a known but obscure or complex phenomenon or theory or system or operating technique may be a very real contribution to the art. Obviously, a paper may well score highly on both originality and contribution. Perhaps the important question is, will the engineer who reads the paper be able to practice his profession more effectively because of having read it?

Presentation. The value of the paper is a function of the ease with which the reader can determine what the author is trying to present. Regardless of the other criteria, a paper is not good unless the material is presented clearly and effectively. Is the paper well written? Is the meaning of the author clear? Are the tables, charts, and figures clear? Is their meaning readily apparent? Is the information presented in the paper complete? At the same time, is the paper concise?

# Dataset Description
Your challenge in this competition is to identify which species (birds, amphibians, mammals, reptiles, insects) are calling in recordings made in the Brazilian Pantanal. This is an important task for scientists who monitor animal populations for conservation purposes. More accurate solutions could enable more comprehensive monitoring.

This competition uses a hidden test set. When your submitted notebook is scored, the actual test data will be made available to your notebook.

Files
train_audio/ The training data consists of short recordings of individual bird, amphibian, reptile, mammal, and insect sounds generously uploaded by users of xeno-canto.org and iNaturalist. These files have been resampled to 32 kHz where applicable to match the test set audio and converted to the ogg format. Filenames consist of [collection][file_id_in_collection].ogg. The training data should have nearly all relevant files; we expect there is no benefit to looking for more on xeno-canto.org or iNaturalist and appreciate your cooperation in limiting the burden on their servers. If you do, please make sure to adhere to the scraping rules of these data portals.

test_soundscapes/ When you submit a notebook, the test_soundscapes directory will be populated with approximately 600 recordings to be used for scoring. They are 1 minute long and in ogg audio format, resampled to 32 kHz. The file names have the general form of BC2026_Test_<file ID>_<site>_<date>_<time in UTC>.ogg (e.g., file BC2026_Test_0001_S05_20250227_010002.ogg has file ID 0001, was recorded at site S05 on Feb 27 2025 at 01:00 UTC). It should take your submission notebook approximately five minutes to load all the test soundscapes. Not all species from the training data actually occur in the test data.

train_soundscapes/ Additional audio data from roughly the same recording locations as the test_soundscapes. Filenames follow the same naming convention as the test_soundscapes; although some recording sites overlap between train and test, precise recording dates and times do NOT overlap with recordings of the hidden test data. This year, some of the train_soundscapes have been labeled by expert annotators, and we provide the ground truth for a subset of train_soundscapes in train_soundscapes_labels.csv with columns filename referencing the soundscape file, start and end referencing the 5-second segment for which column primary_label provides a semicolon-separated list of species codes that have been marked as present in this segment.

Important note: Some species with occurrences in the hidden test data might only have train samples in the labeled portion of train_soundscapes and not in the train_audio (XC and iNat data). However, not all species from train_soundscapes have occurrences in the test_soundscapes.

train.csv A wide range of metadata is provided for the training data. The most directly relevant fields are:

primary_label: A code for the species (eBird code for birds, iNaturalist taxon ID for non-birds). You can review detailed information about the species by appending codes to eBird and iNaturalist taxon URL, such as https://ebird.org/species/brnowl for the Barn Owl or https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/41970 for the Jaguar. Not all species have their own pages; some links might fail.
secondary_labels: List of species labels that have been marked by recordists to also occur in the recording. Can be incomplete.
latitude & longitude: Coordinates for where the recording was taken. Some bird species may have local call 'dialects,' so you may want to seek geographic diversity in your training data.
author: The user who provided the recording. Unknown if no name was provided.
filename: The name of the associated audio file.
rating: Values in 1..5 (1 - low quality, 5 - high quality; 0.5 reduction in rating when background species are present) provided by users of Xeno-canto; 0 implies no rating is available; iNaturalist does not provide quality ratings.
collection: Either XC or iNat, indicating which collection the recording was taken from. Filenames also reference the collection and the ID within that collection.
sample_submission.csv A valid sample submission.

row_id: A slug of [soundscape_filename]_[end_time] for the prediction; e.g., Segment 00:15-00:20 of 1-minute test soundscape BC2026_Test_0001_S05_20250227_010002.ogg has row ID BC2026_Test_0001_S05_20250227_010002_20.
[species_id]: There are 234 species ID columns. You will need to predict the probability of the presence of each species for each row.
taxonomy.csv - Data on the different species, including iNaturalist taxon ID and class name (Aves, Amphibia, Mammalia, Insecta, Reptilia). Most insect species in this competition have not been identified on species level and instead occur as sonotypes (e.g., 47158son16 as insect sonotype 16); these sonotypes are treated as classes despite the lack of species ID and some of them also occur in the test data. The 234 rows of this file represent the 234 class columns in the submission file. primary_label specifies the submission file column name.

recording_location.txt - Some high-level information on the recording location (Pantanal, Brazil).

5. WINNER LICENSE
a. Under Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations) of the General Rules below, you hereby grant and will grant the Competition Sponsor the following license(s) with respect to your Submission if you are a Competition winner:

Open Source: You hereby license and will license your winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see www.opensource.org) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.

For generally commercially available software that you used to generate your Submission that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, you do not need to grant the license in the preceding Section for that software.

In the event that input data or pretrained models with an incompatible license are used to generate your winning solution, you do not need to grant an open source license in the preceding Section for that data and/or model(s).

b. You may be required by the Sponsor to provide a detailed description of how the winning Submission was generated, to the Competition Sponsor’s specifications, as outlined in Section 2.8, Winner’s Obligations. This may include a detailed description of methodology, where one must be able to reproduce the approach by reading the description, and includes a detailed explanation of the architecture, preprocessing, loss function, training details, hyper-parameters, etc. The description should also include a link to a code repository with complete and detailed instructions so that the results obtained can be reproduced.

6. EXTERNAL DATA AND TOOLS
a. You may use data other than the Competition Data (“External Data”) to develop and test your Submissions. However, you will ensure the External Data is either publicly available and equally accessible to use by all Participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other Participants, or satisfies the Reasonableness criteria as outlined in Section 2.6.b below. The ability to use External Data under this Section does not limit your other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations).

b. The use of external data and models is acceptable unless specifically prohibited by the Host. Because of the potential costs or restrictions (e.g., “geo restrictions”) associated with obtaining rights to use external data or certain software and associated tools, their use must be “reasonably accessible to all” and of “minimal cost”. Also, regardless of the cost challenges as they might affect all Participants during the course of the competition, the costs of potentially procuring a license for software used to generate a Submission, must also be considered. The Host will employ an assessment of whether or not the following criteria can exclude the use of the particular LLM, data set(s), or tool(s):

Are Participants being excluded from a competition because of the "excessive" costs for access to certain LLMs, external data, or tools that might be used by other Participants. The Host will assess the excessive cost concern by applying a “Reasonableness” standard (the “Reasonableness Standard”). The Reasonableness Standard will be determined and applied by the Host in light of things like cost thresholds and accessibility.

By way of example only, a small subscription charge to use additional elements of a large language model such as Gemini Advanced are acceptable if meeting the Reasonableness Standard of Sec. 8.2. Purchasing a license to use a proprietary dataset that exceeds the cost of a prize in the competition would not be considered reasonable.

c. Automated Machine Learning Tools (“AMLT”)

Individual Participants and Teams may use automated machine learning tool(s) (“AMLT”) (e.g., Google toML, H2O Driverless AI, etc.) to create a Submission, provided that the Participant or Team ensures that they have an appropriate license to the AMLT such that they are able to comply with the Competition Rules.
7. ELIGIBILITY
a. Unless otherwise stated in the Competition-Specific Rules above or prohibited by internal policies of the Competition Entities, employees, interns, contractors, officers and directors of Competition Entities may enter and participate in the Competition, but are not eligible to win any Prizes. "Competition Entities" means the Competition Sponsor, Kaggle Inc., and their respective parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates. If you are such a Participant from a Competition Entity, you are subject to all applicable internal policies of your employer with respect to your participation.

8. WINNER’S OBLIGATIONS
a. As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:

Deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model's software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should follow these documentation guidelines, must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. For avoidance of doubt, delivered software code should include training code, inference code, and a description of the required computational environment.
a. To the extent that the final model’s software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission; Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner’s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.5 (Winners License), Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations), and Section 3.14 (Warranty, Indemnity, and Release).”

b. Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner’s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules,

Grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license;

Sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (a) eligibility certifications; (b) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (c) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).
